The root cause is that the NGL viewer is not reloading the new PDB properly when the generate/search button is pressed again, even though the fetch and state update logic in App.jsx is correct.

**Why?**
- The NGLViewer component uses a `useRef` for the NGL `Stage` and only creates it once (when `stageRef.current` is null).
- When you press the generate button again, the `pdbContent` prop changes, but the NGL `Stage` is not fully reset/recreatedâ€”only `removeAllComponents()` is called.
- If the new PDB is very different (e.g., different atom count, chain, or format), NGL may not fully reset its internal state, especially if the viewer DOM node is not unmounted/remounted.
- The `isReloading` state and the artificial delay only show a message, but do not force a true NGL viewer reset.

**Proper Solution:**
- You need to fully reset the NGL `Stage` when a new search is performed. The most robust way is to unmount and remount the NGLViewer component (or at least the DOM node used by NGL), so that a new NGL `Stage` is created for each new PDB.
- This can be done by giving the NGLViewer a unique `key` prop based on the PDB content or a reload counter. When the key changes, React will unmount and remount the component, ensuring a fresh NGL stage.

**How to fix:**
1. In App.jsx, add a `nglKey` state that you increment every time a new search is performed.
2. Pass `nglKey` as the `key` prop to `<NGLViewer ... />`.

**Example fix for App.jsx:**
```jsx
const [nglKey, setNglKey] = useState(0);

const handleFormSubmit = async (formData) => {
  setLoading(true);
  setError("");
  setResponse(null);
  setViewerFeatures({ ... }); // as before
  setIsReloading(true);
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 1200));
  setIsReloading(false);
  setNglKey(prev => prev + 1); // <-- increment key to force remount
  // ...fetch logic as before...
};

// In render:
<NGLViewer
  key={nglKey}
  pdbContent={response?.pdb_content}
  viewerFeatures={viewerFeatures}
  colorOptions={colorOptions}
  isPdbLoading={loading}
  isReloading={isReloading}
/>
```

**Result:**  
Every time you search/generate, the NGLViewer will be fully remounted, and the NGL Stage will be recreated, ensuring the new PDB is loaded cleanly.
